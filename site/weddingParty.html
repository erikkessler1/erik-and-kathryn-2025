              Even though they have lived far apart for most of their adult lives, Kathryn and Rose are still very
close thanks to daily texts, semi-weekly zoom calls, and a global pandemic that allowed them to live near each other
for a summer. They enjoy watching tv together via zoom or hiking together when in person. Rose once beat Kathryn at a 
game of Harry Potter Scene It because she has bigger feet, which Kathryn will never get over.

              Erik and his younger sister, Caroline, have grown close in the past few years as they moved to Cambridge together and shared their first apartment. Erik and Caroline have spent numerous hours chatting and working together in coffee shops. Caroline was the first person Erik told about Kathryn!

              Cam is another younger sibling that Erik deeply values his relationship with. Cam lives a few minutes away from Kathryn and Erik in Somerville, and we enjoy having him over for weeknight dinners on occasion. Like Erik, Cam enjoys running along the Charles River, and the three siblings embark on weekend runs together.

            <div class="px-4">
            	Kathryn and Erin first met September of 2017 when they moved to Boston, becoming roommates and great 
friends. They have spent many hours hiking, digging through dumpsters to furnish their apartments, being each others' 
plus-ones to work events, and loving Erin's dog Wendy. While Erin now lives in Nashville, she still likes to tell 
people absurd stories about Kathryn, most of which are false.

            	Like many younger sisters, Kathryn looks up to her older brother, Karl, so we are excited to have him 
officiate our wedding. Karl lives near Denver, Colorado, where he spends his time writing, hiking, working at music 
venues like Red Rocks, and pursuing other creative/artistic ideas. He is also a talented singer and musician.
